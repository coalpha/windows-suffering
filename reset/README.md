# reset

Resetting the computer again, are we?
Here's some instructions so you don't forget.

- [Prepare the image](./image.md)
- While NTLite and Rufus are running, find the a flash drive.
   - stick the btsync rw keys in a text document with what folders they
   correspond to.
   - Put the firefox installer on there
   - Put the NTLite installer on there
   - Put hwid.kms38.gen.exe on there
- Plug the install media into a USB 2.x port or USB C on the target machine. It
won't work with USB 3.
- If the target machine has builtin speakers, plug something into the audio out
port to prevent cortana waking up everyone. Let's be real, you're doing this
late at night.

- First, activate it with the hwid.kms38.gen.exe
